# Clevis-Bracket-
This project features a clevis bracket, a commonly used mechanical linkage component designed to connect two parts through a pin-and-slot arrangement. The bracket includes a forked end with parallel prongs that accommodate a mating component, allowing rotational or pivoting motion when assembled with a pin or bolt. The upper portion of the bracket contains a cylindrical boss with a through-hole, typically used for mounting or attaching the clevis to another structural member.

The part was modeled in SolidWorks using a combination of sketch-based features and extruded geometries to accurately represent the functional design. Key characteristics include:

A two-prong clevis fork for pin connections

Multiple mounting holes sized to typical mechanical fastening standards

Curved and angled profiles providing strength while reducing unnecessary weight

A robust base form to withstand shear and bending loads in practical applications

Clevis brackets like this are widely used in mechanical linkages, hydraulic cylinders, suspension systems, automation machinery, and motion-transfer mechanisms. The design ensures alignment, controlled motion, and reliable load transfer between connected components.

This model focuses on capturing the real-world functional geometry of a clevis bracket while maintaining manufacturability and assembly compatibility, making it suitable for educational, simulation, or engineering documentation purposes.
